                  to shape experiences, not just with aesthetics or
                  functionality, but with a deep understanding of the human

                similar thinking to my design craft. My hope is that this

                curiosity about how the practices of healthcare and design are

                In the unadorned reality of a hospital room, each beep of a
                monitor was a stark reminder of life's precariousness. Here,
                amidst the day-to-day of pediatric oncology and palliative care,
                my understanding of design, my life’s work, shifted
                fundamentally. It became clear that the method’s true value lies
                in its blend of intuitive understanding, the tangible rawness of
                experience, and the clarity that observation can bring. This
                combination is what makes design not just a job, but a deeply
                human pursuit that's validated by real stories and data, and
                driven by the resilience we all share.

                Walking through the hospital's hallways, where every room held
                stories of both joy and struggle, shaped my professional
                principles. I realized that the resilience, the willingness to
                face discomfort, and the commitment to advocate for those we
                serve are as crucial in the craft of design as they are in the
                practice of healthcare. These aren't just abstract concepts;
                they're the concrete foundations that inform every decision I
                make, pushing me to create experiences that endure and
                meaningfully serve people's needs.

                    In observing the resilience of those in the hospital, it
                    wasn't just the physical sturdiness of the building that
                    struck me—it was the quiet, determined resolve of families,
                    like mine, facing each day. This resilience is something I
                    embrace, in life and in my work. Designers with the grit to
                    push through challenges and the perseverance to refine and
                    improve our work continually are the ones who will make the
                    biggest impact. Our designs should offer more than just
                    longevity; they should provide reassurance and a steady hand
                    in the ever-changing flow of life.

                    Advocacy in palliative care is about more than just offering
                    support—it's about actively defending each person's right to
                    dignity and joy, especially in the toughest times. In the
                    design field, we have much to learn from palliative care
                    practitioners. In the quiet moments between what hope was,
                    and what it had to become, our providers stood up for us
                    when we couldn’t find our footing. Designers need to listen
                    to feedback, no matter how raw or tough, and we then use it
                    to champion essential changes. This process goes beyond
                    making things look good; it's about ensuring our designs
                    truly serve and stand for the people who use our products
                    and services, enhancing their own craft, time, and lives in
                    meaningful ways.

                  Discomfort was a given in the hospital, a companion to every
                  child and family member there. But instead of turning away
                  from it, we learned to sit with it, to find the lessons within
                  it, to live in the ‘in-between’. In design, this means not
                  simply papering over the difficult parts but using them as a
                  starting point for progression. Our designs don't just aim to
                  ease the journey; they aim to be a part of it, acknowledging
                  the rough patches. Designers have an obligation to reduce
                  discomfort and distraction; shining a light on those moments
                  to forge paths to new solutions.

                  embraced—resilience, a readiness to sit with discomfort, and a

                  caregiver in our children’s hospital and are now integral to
                  my design ethos. They drive us to craft products and services
                  that provide more than functionality; they offer meaning and
                  support in a sometimes indifferent world. These are the
                  principles I carry with me, infusing my work with the lessons
                  learned from days and nights spent by my baby’s side, ensuring
